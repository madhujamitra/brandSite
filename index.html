                <h3>The Bees Knees</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating
                        from San Francisco, California. The band
                        consists of lead vocalist Bryan Teddy, guitarist
                        Mack Tolkens, guitarist Andrew Green, bassist
                        Kent Zulkee and drummer Freddie Fischer. The
                        band achieved its first commercial success as
                        an unsigned act, drawing attention from
                        manager Cam Adams. Having worked with
                        other popular acts (The Elephant In The Room,
                        One Trick Pony, The Cat’s Meow), Adams was
                        confident the band could succeed even further,
                        pushing them to sign with Magenta Records.</p>
                    <p>
                        From there, the band has soared, gaining international
                        recognition and ranking in the top 10 on the Poster Charts. New
                        fans immediately fell in love with the band’s original and organic
                        attitude, solidifying their place as one of the hottest and fastest
                        up and coming acts of this century. Fans affectionately refer to
                        themselves as “The Hive” and are drawn to their candid and
                        authentic performances on stage. Looking forward to touring in
                        the future, The Bees Knees are currently recording their second
                        studio album, looking to be released in late 2021.
